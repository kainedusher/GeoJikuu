### Overview
GeoJikuu is an open-source Python library designed for geospatial analysis. Although it works in any Python environment, it is particularly suited for use with Pandas DataFrames in Jupyter Notebooks. The current version of GeoJikuu is considered alpha, with GeoJikuu v1.0 set for release later in 2024. Despite being an alpha version, it already offers functionalities for calculating spatial and spatiotemporal descriptive statistics, performing spatial and spatiotemporal aggregation, and conducting spatial and spatiotemporal hypothesis testing. Preliminary documentation is available at geojikuu.com/docs.
